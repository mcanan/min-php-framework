=================

Minimal PHP MVC framework
Developed to be the initial framework to all my Php projects.
The main features will be:
  * Only core functionality
  * Minimal code (always trying to remove innecesary code)
  * Performance (benchmarking and trying to improve speed)

The first concepts was taken from Codeigniter Framework and the book Pro PHP MCV.

#### Folder structure

The framework have a structure like this:

* framework
  * helpers
  * libraries

The app must be in a structure like this:

* app
  * models
  * views
  * controllers
  * conf
  * libraries
  * helpers
  * batchs
  * cache
